# hello-world
# I am trying to find my own way right now, just to get a bit of an exposure to Ruby. I am doing the 'Learn Ruby the Hard Way' exercises. 
# I am on the 23rd exercise: "Read some code". It directed me to go to websites and try to find some Ruby code to read, so here I am.
# Apparently, writing this intro and doing a pull request are initial steps for a Github newbie. Thank for reading.
